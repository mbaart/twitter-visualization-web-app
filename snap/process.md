##Displaying the simple followers
#Step 1
Make unique list of all nodes (profiles)

#Step 2
Add all nodes, then add edges from "twitter_combined.txt"

#Step 3 
Calculate total followers for each graph

#Step 4 
Display this graph using d3 and have it be interactive

##Display the hashtag similarity graph
#Step 1
Create truth table matrix of users and hashtags (gotta use all those .features files somehow)

#Step 2
Create similarity scores (maybe tf-idf???)

#Step 3
Display similarity scores = proximity, when node is clicked (in d3)

#Step 4 - Bonus step
Have ability to toggle hashtags on or off (regen similarity scores and re order graph each time - might be time issue)
